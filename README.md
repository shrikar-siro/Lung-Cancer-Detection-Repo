# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Repo

This project uses YOLOv8 model from Ultralytics to aid in identifiying different types of lung cancers. The classifiable types are Adenocarcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Large Cell Carcinoma.

The model was trained on an image dataset containing 1000+ images, broken into testing, training, and validation datasets. Images showing normal lungs were classified as normal, meaning the patient did not have any type of lung cancer.
